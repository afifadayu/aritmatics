## Arithmetic Sequence

### Given​ ​a​ ​number​ ​N,​ ​print​ ​a​ ​sequence​ ​of​ ​N​ ​numbers​ ​which​ ​has​ ​the​ ​following​ ​properties: 

1. The​ ​first​ ​number​ ​is​ ​always​ ​1  
2. The​ ​numbers​ ​will​ ​be​ ​an​ ​increasing​ ​sequence  
3. The difference between the current number and the next one is increased by 1 (the difference​ ​starts​ ​from​ ​1),​ ​every​ ​time​ ​you​ ​print​ ​the​ ​current​ ​number. 

## Right of Right

### Given a number N, create a right triangle which has N unit length of opposite and adjacent side. The​ ​opposite​ ​side​ ​must​ ​be​ ​right-aligned:  

> N Opposite = N Adjacent

## Sequence

### Given two numbers, N and B. Print N numbers, start from 1. When the current number is equal to 1, then the next sequence will be added by 2. When the current number is more than or equals​ ​to​ ​B,​ ​then​ ​the​ ​next​ ​sequence​ ​will​ ​be​ ​subtracted​ ​by​ ​1.
