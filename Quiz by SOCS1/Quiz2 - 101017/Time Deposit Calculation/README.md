# Time Deposit Calculation

## After you earned some extra money, you finally open a time deposit account (in indonesia, it’s “Deposito Berjangka”). A time deposit account is an account that used by the bank to hold your money for a certain timeframe. During those timeframe, you won’t be able to take out or spend your money. But, the bank will “pay” you in interest (in Indonesia, it’s “bunga”) and deposit it to your time deposit account. The bank usually “pay” you once a year. Given the initial balance of your time deposit account, the yearly interest rate, and the duration in year for the time deposit, you are to determine how much money will your account have after Y year with yearly interest rate​ ​R​ ​with​ ​initial​ ​balance​ ​of​ ​the​ ​time​ ​deposit​ ​account​ ​was​ ​IB. 
  

### Input:

> The first line will have 3 integers IB, R, and Y that denotes the initial balance of the time deposit                    account, the yearly interest rate (in percent), and the duration in year.  
> 0 ≤ IB ≤ 1.000.000  
> ​1 ≤ R ≤ 200  
> 1 ≤ Y ≤ 10

*SAMPLE INPUT*

1st Sample:
1000000​ ​7​ ​10

2nd Sample:
573459​ ​123​ ​7
```

### Output:

> You need to output the time deposit balance at the end of year Y with yearly interest rate of R (in percent). You need to output the value by ​discarding the decimal part​. Don’t discard the decimal part during the computation! ONLY discard the decimal part when you output the value.
