# String

## String manipulator is a program that can manipulate a string as we want. We can use this program to learn about the functions in the “string.h” library. Here are the details of the program:  

> At the beginning of the program, the user is asked to input a string. The length of it must be between 5 and 30 characters.  

```sh

```

> 2. Reverse the string 
> * Show the string in reversed order.  
> 3. Uppercase the string  
> * Show the string in uppercase letters.  
> 4. Check alphabet in the string  
> * The  program will search for alphabet characters in the string.  
> * Then the program will display the number of alphabets contained in the string.  
> 5. Checking word in the string  
> * Ask user to input a word to search.  
> * If the searched word  is found, then show message ”[word] is found”.  
> * If the searched word  is not found, then show message ”[word] is not found”.  
> 6. Split the string  
> * The program will display the words contained in the sentence, separated by a space.
